### Web Scraping

Step1: Crawling all information about product ID and categories Id from Tiki main page

Step2: Crawling the data following product ID

Step3: From one categories, we continue crawl the relate product ID

### Data Cleaning
ðŸ”† After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:
- Remove the data which have exist in database
- Detect the data in same store from **seller** and allow it **null**
- Flatten the nested feild in the data


### ðŸ’¡The Process to automatic Minint the data and insert to database:

ðŸ”»***Main Thread:*** Two array categories_id and product_id is the common resource among the multi threads
    -> The process stop when the categories is empty 

ðŸ”»***Product_id Thread:*** Get the first element in categories list to crawl all product id and add it to product_id list in Main thread

ðŸ”»***Product Data Thread:***
    
   - Task1: Cleaning and insert into 3 DataFrame: product, categories vÃ  seller.
    
   - Task2: Import each DataFrame to  MySQL. Because we share resource between threads so the import thread have to be locked until the process done.
